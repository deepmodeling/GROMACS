/*! \libinternal \brief Declaration of platform-agnostic device stream/queue.
 *
 * The command stream (or command queue) is a sequence of operations that are executed
 * in they order they were issued. Several streams may co-exist to represent concurency.
 * This class declares the interfaces, that are exposed to platform-agnostic code and
 * it should be implemented for each compute architecture (e.g. CUDA and OpenCL).
 *
 * Destruction of the \p DeviceStream calls the destructor of the underlying low-level
 * stream/queue, hence should only be called when the stream is no longer needed. To
 * prevent accidental stream destruction, while copying or moving a \p DeviceStream
 * object, copy and move constructors and copy and move assignments are not allowed
 * and the \p DeviceStream object should be passed as a pointer or constant reference.
