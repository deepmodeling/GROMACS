/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Class encapsulating backend-specific GPU Event objects for synchronization.
 *
 * Please note, that different approaches to device handling in backends lead to the differences
 * in how this object behaves on different platforms.
 *
 * The class serves as a wrapper around native event objects (\c cudaEvent_t in CUDA, \c cl_event
 * in OpenCL, and \c sycl::event in SYCL).
 * It has to balance different approaches to device events:
 * - In CUDA, the event is explicitly created, and then can be enqueued into the device stream,
 * where it serves as a marker, not associated with any specific operation. The only available
 * timing info is the time the event was triggered.
 * - In OpenCL each enqueued operation can return an event associated with it, which can be used
 * to check the status of the operation and its duration.
 * - SYCL is similar to OpenCL, except an event is always returned.
 *
 * Due to the way CUDA works, we opt to create a few persistent DeviceEvents, rather than a new
 * event for each operation.
 * Thus, in CUDA the underlying \c cudaEvent_t object is reused when we want to enqueue a new
 * marker. In OpenCL and SYCL, the underlying object is replaced each time we want to update it.
