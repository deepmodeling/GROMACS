        # 2. We get a ton of warnings for the device-specific pass when the compiler sees our SIMD code.

        # To avoid this, we attempt to find a flag to disable SYCL for non-SYCL files. Unfortunately,
        # when using gmx_find_flag_for_source() that includes calling check_cxx_compiler_flag(),  
        # this in turn exposes a bug in dpcpp, where an object file compiles with -fno-sycl leads to
        # a failed link stage (when the same flag is not used). Since none of this is critical, we handle
        # it by merely checking if it works to compile a source fils with this flag, and choking if SYCL
        # is still enabled.
