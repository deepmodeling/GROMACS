gmx msd has been migrated to the trajectoryanalysis framework
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The tool now uses the Gromacs selection syntax. Rather than piping selections via stdin,
selections are now made using the "-sel" option.

This migration comes with about a 20% speedup in execution time.

TODO: Modify/Delete this segment as features are added back in.
Some rarely used features have yet to be migrated, including:

- Mass weighting of MSDs cannot currently be turned on or off. It is set to on when -mol is set, otherwise off.
- The -tensor option is not yet implemented.
- System COM removal with -rmcomm has not yet been implemented.
- B-factor writing using the -pdb option is not yet supported.
