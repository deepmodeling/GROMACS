Extend supported use-cases for GPU version of update and constraints
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

GPU version of update and constraints can now be used for FEP, except mass and constraints
free-energy perturbation.
       
Reduce time spent in grompp with large numbers of distance restraints
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The time `gmx grompp` spent processing distance restraint has been
changed from quadratic in the number of restraints to linear.

Support for offloading PME to GPU when doing Coulomb FEP
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

PME calculations can be offloaded to GPU when doing Coulomb free-energy perturbations.

CPU SIMD accelerated implementation of harmonic bonds
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

SIMD acceleration for bonds slightly improves performance for systems
with H-bonds only constrained or no constraints. This gives a significant
improvement with multiple time stepping.

Allow offloading GPU update and constraints without direct GPU communication
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Allow domain-decomposition and separate PME rank parallel runs to offload update and
constraints to a GPU with CUDA without requiring the (experimental) direct GPU
communication features to be also enabled.
