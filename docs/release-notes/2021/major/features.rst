Lower energy drift due to SETTLE
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|Gromacs| already applied an improvement to the center of mass calculation in
SETTLE to reduce energy drift in single precision. Now the center of mass
calculation is completely avoided, which significantly reduces the energy
drift when large coordinate values are present. This allows for accurate
simulations of systems with SETTLE up to 1000 nm in size (but note that
constraining with LINCS and SHAKE still introduces significant drift,
which limits the system size to 100 to 200 nm).
